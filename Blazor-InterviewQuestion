				<strong>Certainly! Here are the answers to the .NET Blazor interview questions from basic to advanced:</strong>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span style="text-decoration: underline;">
					<strong>Basic-Level Questions:</strong>
				</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>What is Blazor, and what are its key features?</strong>
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Blazor is an open-source web framework developed by Microsoft.</li>
				<li>It allows developers to build interactive web applications using C# and .NET instead of JavaScript.</li>
				<li>Key features include code sharing between client and server, component-based architecture, and the ability to create reusable UI components.</li>
			</ul>
			<p style="text-align: left;">
				<strong>Explain the difference between Blazor Server and Blazor WebAssembly.</strong>
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Blazor Server runs on the server, rendering UI on the client using a SignalR connection. It has lower client requirements but relies on a constant connection.</li>
				<li>Blazor WebAssembly runs entirely in the client's browser using WebAssembly. It offers a more responsive UI but requires modern browsers.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				<strong>How does Blazor handle rendering and UI updates?</strong>
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Blazor uses a virtual DOM-like mechanism to efficiently update the UI.</li>
				<li>When a component's state changes, Blazor re-renders the component and updates the DOM.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				<br />
				<strong>What are Razor components, and how do they relate to Blazor?</strong>
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Razor components are reusable UI elements in Blazor.</li>
				<li>They consist of a .razor file containing HTML and C# code.</li>
				<li>Razor components are the building blocks of Blazor applications.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				<br />
				<strong>What is the role of the Main method in a Blazor application?</strong>
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>The Main method is the entry point for a Blazor WebAssembly application.</li>
				<li>It initializes the application and renders the root component.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				<br />
				<strong>How does Blazor support data binding?</strong>
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Blazor provides two-way data binding using the @ symbol.</li>
				<li>Data changes in components automatically update the UI, and UI interactions update the underlying data.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				<br />
				<strong>What is the purpose of the @code block in a Razor component?</strong>
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>The @code block contains C# code for the component.</li>
				<li>It defines variables, methods, and event handlers used within the component.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				<br />
				<strong>How can you pass data between components in Blazor?</strong>
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Data can be passed between components using parameters, event callbacks, and services.</li>
				<li>Parameters allow parent components to pass data to child components.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				<br />
				<strong>What is the Blazor component lifecycle, and what are some key lifecycle methods?</strong>
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>The Blazor component lifecycle includes methods like OnInitialized, OnParametersSet, and OnAfterRender.</li>
				<li>These methods are called at specific points in a component's lifecycle, allowing developers to perform actions such as data initialization and DOM manipulation.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				<br />
				<span style="text-decoration: underline;">
					<strong>Intermediate-Level Questions:</strong>
				</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>Explain the concept of Dependency Injection in Blazor. How is it implemented?</strong>
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Dependency Injection in Blazor allows components to request services.</li>
				<li>Services are registered in the DI container, and Blazor injects them into components automatically.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				<br />
				<strong>What are Blazor templates, and when might you use them?</strong>
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Blazor templates are reusable UI structures.</li>
				<li>They are useful for creating consistent layouts and structures across multiple components.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				<br />
				<strong>Describe the differences between event handling in Blazor Server and Blazor WebAssembly.</strong>
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Blazor Server uses SignalR for real-time communication, while Blazor WebAssembly relies on JavaScript for interactivity.</li>
				<li>Event handling in Blazor Server is more immediate, whereas Blazor WebAssembly has client-side interactivity.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				<br />
				<strong>How do you integrate authentication and authorization in a Blazor application?</strong>
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Authentication can be added using Identity, Azure AD, or other authentication providers.</li>
				<li>Authorization can be implemented using policies, roles, and AuthorizeView components.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				<br />
				<strong>What are the advantages and disadvantages of using Blazor for building web applications compared to traditional JavaScript frameworks?</strong>
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Advantages include code sharing, C# expertise, and component reusability.</li>
				<li>Disadvantages include client-side performance limitations and browser compatibility.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				<strong>How can you optimize the performance of a Blazor application, especially in terms of load times?</strong>
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Performance optimization techniques include code splitting, lazy loading, and minimizing JavaScript interop.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				<br />
				<strong>Explain the role of JavaScript Interop in Blazor. When and why might you use it?</strong>
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>JavaScript Interop allows Blazor components to invoke JavaScript functions and access the browser's APIs.</li>
				<li>It's used when you need to integrate with JavaScript libraries or access browser-specific features not available in Blazor.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				<span style="text-decoration: underline;">
					<strong>Advanced-Level Questions:</strong>
				</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>Describe the server-side Blazor architecture in detail. How does it handle real-time communication?</strong>
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Server-side Blazor runs on the server and uses SignalR to communicate with the client.</li>
				<li>UI updates are sent to the client over a SignalR connection, providing real-time interactivity.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				<strong>What are Blazor component lifecycle events, and how can you leverage them for advanced scenarios?</strong>
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Component lifecycle events like OnInitializedAsync and OnAfterRender allow you to perform async operations and manipulate the DOM.</li>
				<li>They're useful for scenarios like data fetching and third-party library integration.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				<br />
				<strong>How can you create custom Blazor components, and what are some best practices for doing so?</strong>
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Custom components are created by defining a .razor file.</li>
				<li>Best practices include keeping components small, using parameters effectively, and following naming conventions.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				<br />
				<strong>Explain the concept of Code-Splitting in Blazor WebAssembly. How can you implement it?</strong>
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Code-Splitting reduces initial load times by only downloading necessary code.</li>
				<li>It can be implemented using lazy loading and dynamic imports.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				<br />
				<strong>What are Web API endpoints, and how can you consume them in a Blazor application?</strong>
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Web API endpoints are HTTP services that provide data.</li>
				<li>Blazor can consume Web API endpoints using HttpClient and asynchronous calls.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				<br />
				<strong>Discuss Progressive Web App (PWA) support in Blazor. How can you turn a Blazor app into a PWA?</strong>
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Blazor WebAssembly apps can be turned into PWAs by adding a manifest file and service worker registration.</li>
				<li>PWAs provide offline access and improved performance.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				<br />
				<strong>How do you manage state in a Blazor application, and what are the available options?</strong>
