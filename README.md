## Blazor Interview Questions & Answers


Certainly! Here are the answers to the .NET Blazor interview questions from basic to advanced:**

## Basic-Level Questions:

**What is Blazor, and what are its key features?**

- Blazor is an open-source web framework developed by Microsoft.
- It allows developers to build interactive web applications using C# and .NET instead of JavaScript.
- Key features include code sharing between client and server, component-based architecture, and the ability to create reusable UI components.

**Explain the difference between Blazor Server and Blazor WebAssembly.**

- Blazor Server runs on the server, rendering UI on the client using a SignalR connection.
- It has lower client requirements but relies on a constant connection.
- Blazor WebAssembly runs entirely in the client's browser using WebAssembly. It offers a more responsive UI but requires modern browsers.

**How does Blazor handle rendering and UI updates?**

- Blazor uses a virtual DOM-like mechanism to efficiently update the UI.
- When a component's state changes, Blazor re-renders the component and updates the DOM.

**What are Razor components, and how do they relate to Blazor?**

- Razor components are reusable UI elements in Blazor.
- They consist of a .razor file containing HTML and C# code.
- Razor components are the building blocks of Blazor applications.

**What is the role of the Main method in a Blazor application?**

- The Main method is the entry point for a Blazor WebAssembly application.
- It initializes the application and renders the root component.

**How does Blazor support data binding?**

- Blazor provides two-way data binding using the @ symbol.
- Data changes in components automatically update the UI, and UI interactions update the underlying data.

**What is the purpose of the @code block in a Razor component?**

- The @code block contains C# code for the component.
- It defines variables, methods, and event handlers used within the component.

**How can you pass data between components in Blazor?**

- Data can be passed between components using parameters, event callbacks, and services.
- Parameters allow parent components to pass data to child components.

**What is the Blazor component lifecycle, and what are some key lifecycle methods?**

- The Blazor component lifecycle includes methods like OnInitialized, OnParametersSet, and OnAfterRender.
- These methods are called at specific points in a component's lifecycle, allowing developers to perform actions such as data initialization and DOM manipulation.

## Intermediate-Level Questions:

**Explain the concept of Dependency Injection in Blazor. How is it implemented?**

- Dependency Injection in Blazor allows components to request services.
- Services are registered in the DI container, and Blazor injects them into components automatically.

**What are Blazor templates, and when might you use them?**

- Blazor templates are reusable UI structures.
- They are useful for creating consistent layouts and structures across multiple components.

**Describe the differences between event handling in Blazor Server and Blazor WebAssembly.**

- Blazor Server uses SignalR for real-time communication, while Blazor WebAssembly relies on JavaScript for interactivity.
- Event handling in Blazor Server is more immediate, whereas Blazor WebAssembly has client-side interactivity.

**How do you integrate authentication and authorization in a Blazor application?**

Authentication can be added using Identity, Azure AD, or other authentication providers.
Authorization can be implemented using policies, roles, and AuthorizeView components.

**What are the advantages and disadvantages of using Blazor for building web applications compared to traditional JavaScript frameworks?**

- Advantages include code sharing, C# expertise, and component reusability.
- Disadvantages include client-side performance limitations and browser compatibility.

**How can you optimize the performance of a Blazor application, especially in terms of load times?**

- Performance optimization techniques include code splitting, lazy loading, and minimizing JavaScript interop.

**Explain the role of JavaScript Interop in Blazor. When and why might you use it?**

- JavaScript Interop allows Blazor components to invoke JavaScript functions and access the browser's APIs.
- It's used when you need to integrate with JavaScript libraries or access browser-specific features not available in Blazor.

## Advanced-Level Questions:

**Describe the server-side Blazor architecture in detail. How does it handle real-time communication?**

- Server-side Blazor runs on the server and uses SignalR to communicate with the client.
- UI updates are sent to the client over a SignalR connection, providing real-time interactivity.

**What are Blazor component lifecycle events, and how can you leverage them for advanced scenarios?**

- Component lifecycle events like OnInitializedAsync and OnAfterRender allow you to perform async operations and manipulate the DOM.
- They're useful for scenarios like data fetching and third-party library integration.

**How can you create custom Blazor components, and what are some best practices for doing so?**

- Custom components are created by defining a .razor file.
- Best practices include keeping components small, using parameters effectively, and following naming conventions.

**Explain the concept of Code-Splitting in Blazor WebAssembly. How can you implement it?**

- Code-Splitting reduces initial load times by only downloading necessary code.
- It can be implemented using lazy loading and dynamic imports.

**What are Web API endpoints, and how can you consume them in a Blazor application?**

- Web API endpoints are HTTP services that provide data.
- Blazor can consume Web API endpoints using HttpClient and asynchronous calls.

**Discuss Progressive Web App (PWA) support in Blazor. How can you turn a Blazor app into a PWA?**

- Blazor WebAssembly apps can be turned into PWAs by adding a manifest file and service worker registration.
- PWAs provide offline access and improved performance.

**How do you manage state in a Blazor application, and what are the available options?**

- State management options include component state, services, and state containers like Flux/Redux patterns or third-party libraries.

**Can Blazor be used for cross-platform mobile app development? Explain.**

- Yes, Blazor can be used for cross-platform mobile app development through Blazor WebAssembly.
- Blazor Mobile Bindings is another option for mobile development with Blazor.
